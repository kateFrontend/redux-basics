# Redux Basics

**Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions".** It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

## React-redux

Redux can integrate with any UI framework (Angular, Vue, Vanila Js etc.), and is most frequently used with React. React-Redux is an official package that lets your React components interact with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the store.
